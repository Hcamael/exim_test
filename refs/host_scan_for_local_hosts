<doc f='exim/src/host.c' l='1340'>/* Scan through a chain of addresses and check whether any of them is the
address of an interface on the local machine. If so, remove that address and
any previous ones with the same MX value, and all subsequent ones (which will
have greater or equal MX values) from the chain. Note: marking them as unusable
is NOT the right thing to do because it causes the hosts not to be used for
other domains, for which they may well be correct.

The hosts may be part of a longer chain; we only process those between the
initial pointer and the &quot;last&quot; pointer.

There is also a list of &quot;pseudo-local&quot; host names which are checked against the
host names. Any match causes that host item to be treated the same as one which
matches a local IP address.

If the very first host is a local host, then all MX records had a precedence
greater than or equal to that of the local host. Either there&apos;s a problem in
the DNS, or an apparently remote name turned out to be an abbreviation for the
local host. Give a specific return code, and let the caller decide what to do.
Otherwise, give a success code if at least one host address has been found.

Arguments:
  host        pointer to the first host in the chain
  lastptr     pointer to pointer to the last host in the chain (may be updated)
  removed     if not NULL, set TRUE if some local addresses were removed
                from the list

Returns:
  HOST_FOUND       if there is at least one host with an IP address on the chain
                     and an MX value less than any MX value associated with the
                     local host
  HOST_FOUND_LOCAL if a local host is among the lowest-numbered MX hosts; when
                     the host addresses were obtained from A records or
                     gethostbyname(), the MX values are set to -1.
  HOST_FIND_FAILED if no valid hosts with set IP addresses were found
