<doc f='exim/src/search.c' l='285'>/* A mode, and lists of owners and groups, are passed over for checking in
the cases where the database is one or more files. Return NULL, with a message
pointed to by message, in cases of error.

For search types that use a file or files, check up on the mode after
opening. It is tempting to do a stat before opening the file, and use it as
an existence check. However, doing that opens a small security loophole in
that the status could be changed before the file is opened. Can&apos;t quite see
what problems this might lead to, but you can&apos;t be too careful where security
is concerned. Fstat() on an open file can normally be expected to succeed,
but there are some NFS states where it does not.

There are two styles of query: (1) in the &quot;single-key+file&quot; style, a single
key string and a file name are given, for example, for linear searches, DBM
files, or for NIS. (2) In the &quot;query&quot; style, no &quot;filename&quot; is given; instead
just a single query string is passed. This applies to multiple-key lookup
types such as NIS+.

Before opening, scan the tree of cached files to see if this file is already
open for the correct search type. If so, return the saved handle. If not, put
the handle in the tree for possible subsequent use. See search_tidyup above for
closing all the cached files.

A count of open databases which use real files is maintained, and if this
gets too large, we have to close a cached file. Its entry remains in the tree,
but is marked closed.

Arguments:
  filename       the name of the file for single-key+file style lookups,
                 NULL for query-style lookups
  search_type    the type of search required
  modemask       if a real single file is used, this specifies mode bits that
                 must not be set; otherwise it is ignored
  owners         if a real single file is used, this specifies the possible
                 owners of the file; otherwise it is ignored
  owngroups      if a real single file is used, this specifies the possible
                 group owners of the file; otherwise it is ignored

Returns:         an identifying handle for the open database;
                 this is the pointer to the tree block in the
                 cache of open files; return NULL on open failure, with
                 a message in search_error_message
