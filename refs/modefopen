<doc f='exim/src/exim.c' l='436'>/* Exim runs with umask(0) so that files created with open() have the mode that
is specified in the open() call. However, there are some files, typically in
the spool directory, that are created with fopen(). They end up world-writeable
if no precautions are taken. Although the spool directory is not accessible to
the world, this is an untidiness. So this is a wrapper function for fopen()
that sorts out the mode of the created file.

Arguments:
   filename       the file name
   options        the fopen() options
   mode           the required mode

Returns:          the fopened FILE or NULL
