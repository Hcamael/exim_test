<doc f='exim/src/dns.c' l='836'>/* Look up the given domain name, using the given type. Follow CNAMEs if
necessary, but only so many times. There aren&apos;t supposed to be CNAME chains in
the DNS, but you are supposed to cope with them if you find them.

The assumption is made that if the resolver gives back records of the
requested type *and* a CNAME, we don&apos;t need to make another call to look up
the CNAME. I can&apos;t see how it could return only some of the right records. If
it&apos;s done a CNAME lookup in the past, it will have all of them; if not, it
won&apos;t return any.

If fully_qualified_name is not NULL, set it to point to the full name
returned by the resolver, if this is different to what it is given, unless
the returned name starts with &quot;*&quot; as some nameservers seem to be returning
wildcards in this form.  In international mode &quot;different&quot; means &quot;alabel
forms are different&quot;.

Arguments:
  dnsa                  pointer to dns_answer structure
  name                  domain name to look up
  type                  DNS record type (T_A, T_MX, etc)
  fully_qualified_name  if not NULL, return the returned name here if its
                          contents are different (i.e. it must be preset)

Returns:                DNS_SUCCEED   successful lookup
                        DNS_NOMATCH   name not found
                        DNS_NODATA    no data found
                        DNS_AGAIN     soft failure, try again later
                        DNS_FAIL      DNS failure
