<doc f='exim/src/verify.c' l='2328'>/* This function checks that every (envelope) recipient is mentioned in either
the To: or Cc: header lines, thus detecting blind carbon copies.

There are two ways of scanning that could be used: either scan the header lines
and tick off the recipients, or scan the recipients and check the header lines.
The original proposed patch did the former, but I have chosen to do the latter,
because (a) it requires no memory and (b) will use fewer resources when there
are many addresses in To: and/or Cc: and only one or two envelope recipients.

Arguments:   none
Returns:     OK    if there are no blind recipients
             FAIL  if there is at least one blind recipient
