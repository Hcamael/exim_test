<doc f='exim/src/tls-openssl.c' l='2806'>/* There have historically been some issues with binary compatibility in
OpenSSL libraries; if Exim (like many other applications) is built against
one version of OpenSSL but the run-time linker picks up another version,
it can result in serious failures, including crashing with a SIGSEGV.  So
report the version found by the compiler and the run-time version.

Note: some OS vendors backport security fixes without changing the version
number/string, and the version date remains unchanged.  The _build_ date
will change, so we can more usefully assist with version diagnosis by also
reporting the build date.

Arguments:   a FILE* to print the results to
Returns:     nothing
