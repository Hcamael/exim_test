<doc f='exim/src/structs.h' l='482'>/* The address_item structure contains many fields which are used at various
times while delivering a message. Some are used only for remote deliveries;
some only for local. A particular set of fields is copied whenever a child
address is created. For convenience, we keep those fields in a separate
sub-structure so they can be copied in one go. This also means I won&apos;t forget
to edit the various copying places when new to-be-copied fields are added. */</doc>
