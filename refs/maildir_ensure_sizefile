<doc f='exim/src/transports/tf_maildir.c' l='349'>/* This function is called before a delivery if the option to use
maildirsizefile is enabled. Its function is to create the file if it does not
exist, or to update it if that is necessary.

The logic in this function follows the rules that are described in

  http://www.inter7.com/courierimap/README.maildirquota.html

Or, at least, it is supposed to!

Arguments:
  path             the path to the maildir directory; this is already backed-up
                     to the parent if the delivery directory is a maildirfolder
  ob               the appendfile options block
  regex            a compiled regex for getting a file&apos;s size from its name
  dir_regex        a compiled regex for selecting maildir directories
  returned_size    where to return the current size of the maildir, even if
                     the maildirsizefile is removed because of a race

Returns:           &gt;=0  a file descriptor for an open maildirsize file
                   -1   there was an error opening or accessing the file
                   -2   the file was removed because of a race
