Arguments:
  code        points to the coded string, zero-terminated
  ptr         where to put the pointer to the result, which is in
              dynamic store

Returns:      the number of bytes in the result,
              or -1 if the input was malformed

A zero is added on to the end to make it easy in cases where the result is to
be interpreted as text. This is not included in the count. */</doc>
