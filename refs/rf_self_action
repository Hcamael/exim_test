<doc f='exim/src/routers/rf_self_action.c' l='18'>/* This function is called from a number of routers on receiving
HOST_FOUND_LOCAL when looking up a supposedly remote host. The action is
controlled by a generic configuration option called &quot;self&quot; on each router,
which can be one of:

   . freeze:                       Log the incident, freeze, and return DEFER

   . defer:                        Log the incident and return DEFER

   . fail:                         Fail the address

   . send:                         Carry on with the delivery regardless -
                                   this makes sense only if the SMTP
                                   listener on this machine is a differently
                                   configured MTA

   . pass:                         The router passes; the address
                                   gets passed to the next router, overriding
                                   the setting of no_more

   . reroute:&lt;new-domain&gt;          Change the domain to the given domain
                                   and return REROUTE so it gets passed back
                                   to the routers.

   . reroute:rewrite:&lt;new-domain&gt;  The same, but headers containing the
                                   old domain get rewritten.

These string values are interpreted earlier on, and passed into this function
as the values of &quot;code&quot; and &quot;rewrite&quot;.

Arguments:
  addr       the address being routed
  host       the host that is local, with MX set (or -1 if MX not used)
  code       the action to be taken (one of the self_xxx enums)
  rewrite    TRUE if rewriting headers required for REROUTED
  new        new domain to be used for REROUTED
  addr_new   child chain for REROUTEED

Returns:   DEFER, REROUTED, PASS, FAIL, or OK, according to the value of code.
