<doc f='exim/src/local_scan.h' l='93'>/* Some people (Marc Merlin et al) are maintaining a patch that allows for
dynamic local_scan() libraries. This code is not yet in Exim proper, but it
helps the maintainers if we keep their ABI version numbers here. This may
mutate into more general support later. The major number is increased when the
ABI is changed in a non backward compatible way. The minor number is increased
each time a new feature is added (in a way that doesn&apos;t break backward
compatibility). */</doc>
