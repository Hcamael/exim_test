 * Application-specified log record types start at DB_user_BEGIN, and must not
 * equal or exceed DB_debug_FLAG.
 *
 * DB_debug_FLAG is the high-bit of the u_int32_t that specifies a log record
 * type.  If the flag is set, it&apos;s a log record that was logged for debugging
 * purposes only, even if it reflects a database change -- the change was part
 * of a non-durable transaction.
