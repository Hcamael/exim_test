 * The old locking functions have been removed completely without compatibility
 * macros. This is because the old functions either could not properly report
 * errors, or the returned error values were not clearly documented.
 * Replacing the locking functions with with no-ops would cause race condition
 * issues in the affected applications. It is far better for them to fail at
 * compile time.
 * On the other hand, the locking callbacks are no longer used.  Consequently,
 * the callback management functions can be safely replaced with no-op macros.
