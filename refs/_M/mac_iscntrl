<doc f='exim/src/macros.h' l='55'>/* Character-handling macros. It seems that the set of standard functions in
ctype.h aren&apos;t actually all that useful. One reason for this is that email is
international, so the concept of using a locale to vary what they do is not
helpful. Another problem is that in different operating systems, the libraries
yield different results, even in the default locale. For example, Linux yields
TRUE for iscntrl() for all characters &gt; 127, whereas many other systems yield
FALSE. For these reasons we define our own set of macros for a number of
character testing functions. Ensure that all these tests treat their arguments
as unsigned. */</doc>
