<doc f='exim/src/macros.h' l='690'>/* There&apos;s a high-ish bit which is used to flag duplicate options, kept
for compatibility, which shouldn&apos;t be output. Also used for hidden options
that are automatically maintained from others. Another high bit is used to
flag driver options that although private (so as to be settable only on some
drivers), are stored in the instance block so as to be accessible from outside.
A third high bit is set when an option is read, so as to be able to give an
error if any option is set twice. Finally, there&apos;s a bit which is set when an
option is set with the &quot;hide&quot; prefix, to prevent -bP from showing it to
non-admin callers. The next byte up in the int is used to keep the bit number
for booleans that are kept in one bit. */</doc>
