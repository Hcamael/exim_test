 * DBC_DONTLOCK and DBC_RECOVER are used during recovery and transaction
 * abort.  If a transaction is being aborted or recovered then DBC_RECOVER
 * will be set and locking and logging will be disabled on this cursor.  If
 * we are performing a compensating transaction (e.g. free page processing)
 * then DB_DONTLOCK will be set to inhibit locking, but logging will still
 * be required. DB_DONTLOCK is also used if the whole database is locked.
