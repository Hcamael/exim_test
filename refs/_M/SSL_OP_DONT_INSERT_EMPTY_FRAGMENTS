 * Disable SSL 3.0/TLS 1.0 CBC vulnerability workaround that was added in
 * OpenSSL 0.9.6d.  Usually (depending on the application protocol) the
 * workaround is not needed.  Unfortunately some broken SSL/TLS
 * implementations cannot handle it at all, which is why we include it in
 * SSL_OP_ALL. Added in 0.9.6e
