<doc f='exim/src/enq.c' l='20'>/* This function is called when a host is listed for serialization of
connections. It is also called when ETRN is listed for serialization. We open
the misc database and look for a record, which implies an existing connection
or ETRN run. If increasing the count would take us past the given limit
value return FALSE.  If not, bump it and return TRUE.  If not found, create
one with value 1 and return TRUE.

Arguments:
  key            string on which to serialize
  lim            parallelism limit

Returns:         TRUE if OK to proceed; FALSE otherwise
