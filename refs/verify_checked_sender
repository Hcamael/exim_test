<doc f='exim/src/verify.c' l='2416'>/* Usually, just a single address is verified as the sender of the message.
However, Exim can be made to verify other addresses as well (often related in
some way), and this is useful in some environments. There may therefore be a
chain of such addresses that have previously been tested. This function finds
whether a given address is on the chain.

Arguments:   the address to be verified
Returns:     pointer to an address item, or NULL
