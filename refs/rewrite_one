<doc f='exim/src/rewrite.c' l='76'>/* The yield is the input address if there is no rewriting to be done. Assume
the input is a valid address, except in the case of SMTP-time rewriting, which
is handled specially. When this function is called while processing filter and
forward files, the uid may be that of the user. Ensure it is reset while
expanding a replacement, in case that involves file lookups.

Arguments:
  s              address to rewrite
  flag           indicates where this address comes from; it must match the
                   flags in the rewriting rule
  whole          if not NULL, set TRUE if any rewriting rule contained the
                   &quot;whole&quot; bit and it is a header that is being rewritten
  add_header     if TRUE and rewriting occurs, add an &quot;X-rewrote-xxx&quot; header
                   if headers are in existence; this should be TRUE only when
                   a message is being received, not during delivery
  name           name of header, for use when adding X-rewrote-xxxx
  rewrite_rules  chain of rewriting rules

Returns:         new address if rewritten; the input address if no change;
                 for a header rewrite, if the &quot;whole&quot; bit is set, the entire
                 rewritten address is returned, not just the active bit.
