<doc f='exim/src/verify.c' l='2641'>/* Attempt to get an id from the sending machine via the RFC 1413 protocol. If
the timeout is set to zero, then the query is not done. There may also be lists
of hosts and nets which are exempt. To guard against malefactors sending
non-printing characters which could, for example, disrupt a message&apos;s headers,
make sure the string consists of printing characters only.

Argument:
  port    the port to connect to; usually this is IDENT_PORT (113), but when
          running in the test harness with -bh a different value is used.

Returns:  nothing

Side effect: any received ident value is put in sender_ident (NULL otherwise)
