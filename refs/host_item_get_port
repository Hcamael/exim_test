<doc f='exim/src/host.c' l='446'>/* This function is called when finding the IP address for a host that is in a
list of hosts explicitly configured, such as in the manualroute router, or in a
fallback hosts list. We see if there is a port specification at the end of the
host name, and if so, remove it. A minimum length of 3 is required for the
original name; nothing shorter is recognized as having a port.

We test for a name ending with a sequence of digits; if preceded by colon we
have a port if the character before the colon is ] and the name starts with [
or if there are no other colons in the name (i.e. it&apos;s not an IPv6 address).

Arguments:  pointer to the host item
Returns:    a port number or PORT_NONE
