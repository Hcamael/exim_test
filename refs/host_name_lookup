<doc f='exim/src/host.c' l='1620'>/* Put the name in permanent store, pointed to by sender_host_name. We also set
up a list of alias names, pointed to by sender_host_alias. The list is
NULL-terminated. The incoming address is in sender_host_address, either in
dotted-quad form for IPv4 or in colon-separated form for IPv6.

This function does a thorough check that the names it finds point back to the
incoming IP address. Any that do not are discarded. Note that this is relied on
by the ACL reverse_host_lookup check.

On some systems, get{host,ipnode}byaddr() appears to do this internally, but
this it not universally true. Also, for release 4.30, this function was changed
to do a direct DNS lookup first, by default[1], because it turns out that that
is the only guaranteed way to find all the aliases on some systems. My
experiments indicate that Solaris gethostbyaddr() gives the aliases for but
Linux does not.

[1] The actual order is controlled by the host_lookup_order option.

Arguments:    none
Returns:      OK on success, the answer being placed in the global variable
                sender_host_name, with any aliases in a list hung off
                sender_host_aliases
              FAIL if no host name can be found
              DEFER if a temporary error was encountered

The variable host_lookup_msg is set to an empty string on success, or to a
reason for the failure otherwise, in a form suitable for tagging onto an error
message, and also host_lookup_failed is set TRUE if the lookup failed. If there
was a defer, host_lookup_deferred is set TRUE.

Any dynamically constructed string for host_lookup_msg must be in permanent
store, because it might be used for several incoming messages on the same SMTP
connection. */</doc>
