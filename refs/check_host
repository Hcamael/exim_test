<doc f='exim/src/verify.c' l='2795'>/* This function compares a host (name or address) against a single item
from a host list. The host name gets looked up if it is needed and is not
already known. The function is called from verify_check_this_host() via
match_check_list(), which is why most of its arguments are in a single block.

Arguments:
  arg            the argument block (see below)
  ss             the host-list item
  valueptr       where to pass back looked up data, or NULL
  error          for error message when returning ERROR

The block contains:
  host_name      (a) the host name, or
                 (b) NULL, implying use sender_host_name and
                       sender_host_aliases, looking them up if required, or
                 (c) the empty string, meaning that only IP address matches
                       are permitted
  host_address   the host address
  host_ipv4      the IPv4 address taken from an IPv6 one

Returns:         OK      matched
                 FAIL    did not match
                 DEFER   lookup deferred
                 ERROR   (a) failed to find the host name or IP address, or
                         (b) unknown lookup type specified, or
                         (c) host name encountered when only IP addresses are
                               being matched
