	 * are not thread-protected, even when they may be modified at any
	 * time by the application.  The reason is the DB_MPOOLFILE handle
	 * is single-threaded from the viewpoint of the application, and so
	 * the only fields needing to be thread-protected are those accessed
	 * by checkpoint or sync threads when using DB_MPOOLFILE structures
	 * to flush buffers from the cache.
