<doc f='exim/src/receive.c' l='1525'>/* Receive a message on the given input, and put it into a pair of spool files.
Either a non-null list of recipients, or the extract flag will be true, or
both. The flag sender_local is true for locally generated messages. The flag
submission_mode is true if an ACL has obeyed &quot;control = submission&quot;. The flag
suppress_local_fixups is true if an ACL has obeyed &quot;control =
suppress_local_fixups&quot; or -G was passed on the command-line.
The flag smtp_input is true if the message is to be
handled using SMTP conventions about termination and lines starting with dots.
For non-SMTP messages, dot_ends is true for dot-terminated messages.

If a message was successfully read, message_id[0] will be non-zero.

The general actions of this function are:

  . Read the headers of the message (if any) into a chain of store
    blocks.

  . If there is a &quot;sender:&quot; header and the message is locally originated,
    throw it away, unless the caller is trusted, or unless
    active_local_sender_retain is set - which can only happen if
    active_local_from_check is false.

  . If recipients are to be extracted from the message, build the
    recipients list from the headers, removing any that were on the
    original recipients list (unless extract_addresses_remove_arguments is
    false), and at the same time, remove any bcc header that may be present.

  . Get the spool file for the data, sort out its unique name, open
    and lock it (but don&apos;t give it the name yet).

  . Generate a &quot;Message-Id&quot; header if the message doesn&apos;t have one, for
    locally-originated messages.

  . Generate a &quot;Received&quot; header.

  . Ensure the recipients list is fully qualified and rewritten if necessary.

  . If there are any rewriting rules, apply them to the sender address
    and also to the headers.

  . If there is no from: header, generate one, for locally-generated messages
    and messages in &quot;submission mode&quot; only.

  . If the sender is local, check that from: is correct, and if not, generate
    a Sender: header, unless message comes from a trusted caller, or this
    feature is disabled by active_local_from_check being false.

  . If there is no &quot;date&quot; header, generate one, for locally-originated
    or submission mode messages only.

  . Copy the rest of the input, or up to a terminating &quot;.&quot; if in SMTP or
    dot_ends mode, to the data file. Leave it open, to hold the lock.

  . Write the envelope and the headers to a new file.

  . Set the name for the header file; close it.

  . Set the name for the data file; close it.

Because this function can potentially be called many times in a single
SMTP connection, all store should be got by store_get(), so that it will be
automatically retrieved after the message is accepted.

FUDGE: It seems that sites on the net send out messages with just LF
terminators, despite the warnings in the RFCs, and other MTAs handle this. So
we make the CRs optional in all cases.

July 2003: Bare CRs in messages, especially in header lines, cause trouble. A
new regime is now in place in which bare CRs in header lines are turned into LF
followed by a space, so as not to terminate the header line.

February 2004: A bare LF in a header line in a message whose first line was
terminated by CRLF is treated in the same way as a bare CR.

Arguments:
  extract_recip  TRUE if recipients are to be extracted from the message&apos;s
                   headers

Returns:  TRUE   there are more messages to be read (SMTP input)
          FALSE  there are no more messages to be read (non-SMTP input
                 or SMTP connection collapsed, or other failure)

When reading a message for filter testing, the returned value indicates
whether the headers (which is all that is read) were terminated by &apos;.&apos; or
not. */</doc>
