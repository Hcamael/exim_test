<doc f='exim/src/routers/dnslookup.c' l='109'>/* See local README for interface details. This router returns:

DECLINE
  . the domain does not exist in the DNS
  . MX records point to non-existent hosts (including RHS = IP address)
  . a single SRV record has a host name of &quot;.&quot; (=&gt; no service)
  . syntactically invalid mail domain
  . check_secondary_mx set, and local host not in host list

DEFER
  . lookup defer for mx_domains
  . timeout etc on DNS lookup
  . verifying the errors address caused a deferment or a big disaster such
      as an expansion failure (rf_get_errors_address)
  . expanding a headers_{add,remove} string caused a deferment or another
      expansion error (rf_get_munge_headers)
  . a problem in rf_get_transport: no transport when one is needed;
      failed to expand dynamic transport; failed to find dynamic transport
  . failure to expand or find a uid/gid (rf_get_ugid via rf_queue_add)
  . self = &quot;freeze&quot;, self = &quot;defer&quot;

PASS
  . timeout etc on DNS lookup and pass_on_timeout set
  . self = &quot;pass&quot;

REROUTED
  . routed to local host, but name was expanded by DNS lookup, so a
      re-routing should take place
  . self = &quot;reroute&quot;

  In both cases the new address will have been set up as a child

FAIL
  . self = &quot;fail&quot;

OK
  added address to addr_local or addr_remote, as appropriate for the
  type of transport; this includes the self=&quot;send&quot; case.
