<doc f='exim/src/receive.c' l='217'>/* This function is called before accepting a message; if any thresholds are
set, it checks them. If a message_size is supplied, it checks that there is
enough space for that size plus the threshold - i.e. that the message won&apos;t
reduce the space to the threshold. Not all OS have statvfs(); for those that
don&apos;t, this function always returns TRUE. For some OS the old function and
struct name statfs is used; that is handled by a macro, defined in exim.h.

Arguments:
  msg_size     the (estimated) size of an incoming message

Returns:       FALSE if there isn&apos;t enough space, or if the information cannot
                 be obtained
               TRUE if no check was done or there is enough space
