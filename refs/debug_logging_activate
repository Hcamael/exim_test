<doc f='exim/src/log.c' l='1383'>/* Normally, debugging is activated from the command-line; it may be useful
within the configuration to activate debugging later, based on certain
conditions.  If debugging is already in progress, we return early, no action
taken (besides debug-logging that we wanted debug-logging).

Failures in options are not fatal but will result in paniclog entries for the
misconfiguration.

The first use of this is in ACL logic, &quot;control = debug/tag=foo/opts=+expand&quot;
which can be combined with conditions, etc, to activate extra logging only
for certain sources. The second use is inetd wait mode debug preservation. */</doc>
