<doc f='exim/src/spool_in.c' l='21'>/* The data file is the one that is used for locking, because the header file
can get replaced during delivery because of header rewriting. The file has
to opened with write access so that we can get an exclusive lock, but in
fact it won&apos;t be written to. Just in case there&apos;s a major disaster (e.g.
overwriting some other file descriptor with the value of this one), open it
with append.

As called by deliver_message() (at least) we are operating as root.

Argument: the id of the message
Returns:  fd if file successfully opened and locked, else -1

Side effect: message_subdir is set for the (possibly split) spool directory
