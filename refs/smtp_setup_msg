<doc f='exim/src/smtp_in.c' l='3750'>/* This function conducts the initial dialogue at the start of an incoming SMTP
message, and builds a list of recipients. However, if the incoming message
is part of a batch (-bS option) a separate function is called since it would
be messy having tests splattered about all over this function. This function
therefore handles the case where interaction is occurring. The input and output
files are set up in smtp_in and smtp_out.

The global recipients_list is set to point to a vector of recipient_item
blocks, whose number is given by recipients_count. This is extended by the
receive_add_recipient() function. The global variable sender_address is set to
the sender&apos;s address. The yield is +1 if a message has been successfully
started, 0 if a QUIT command was encountered or the connection was refused from
the particular host, or -1 if the connection was lost.

Argument: none

Returns:  &gt; 0 message successfully started (reached DATA)
          = 0 QUIT read or end of file reached or call refused
          &lt; 0 lost connection
