driver that is compiled into the code is represented by a xxx_info block; the
active drivers are represented by a chain of xxx_instance blocks. To make it
possible to use the same code for reading the configuration files for all
three, the layout of the start of the blocks is kept the same, and represented
by the generic structures driver_info and driver_instance. */</doc>
