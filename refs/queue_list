as quickly as possible, then scan each one for information to output. If any
disappear while we are processing, just leave them out, but give an error if an
explicit list was given. This function is a top-level function that is obeyed
as a result of the -bp argument. As there may be a lot of messages on the
queue, we must tidy up the store after reading the headers for each one.

Arguments:
   option     0 =&gt; list top-level recipients, with &quot;D&quot; for those delivered
              1 =&gt; list only undelivered top-level recipients
              2 =&gt; as 0, plus any generated delivered recipients
              If 8 is added to any of these values, the queue is listed in
                random order.
   list       =&gt; first of any message ids to list
   count      count of message ids; 0 =&gt; all

Returns:      nothing
