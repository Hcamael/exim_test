<doc f='exim/src/filtertest.c' l='19'>/* We have to read the remainder of the message in order to find its size, so
we can set up the message_body variables at the same time (in normal use, the
message_body variables are not set up unless needed). The reading code is
written out here rather than having options in read_message_data, in order to
keep that function as efficient as possible. (Later: this function is now
global because it is also used by the -bem testing option.) Handling
message_body_end is somewhat more tedious. Pile it all into a circular buffer
and sort out at the end.

Arguments:
  dot_ended   TRUE if message already terminated by &apos;.&apos;

Returns:      nothing
