<doc f='exim/src/deliver.c' l='5060'>/* This function initializes an address for routing by splitting it up into a
local part and a domain. The local part is set up twice - once in its original
casing, and once in lower case, and it is dequoted. We also do the &quot;percent
hack&quot; for configured domains. This may lead to a DEFER result if a lookup
defers. When a percent-hacking takes place, we insert a copy of the original
address as a new parent of this address, as if we have had a redirection.

Argument:
  addr      points to an addr_item block containing the address

Returns:    OK
            DEFER   - could not determine if domain is %-hackable
