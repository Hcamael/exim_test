<doc f='exim/src/retry.c' l='270'>/* Retry items are chained onto an address when it is deferred either by router
or by a transport, or if it succeeds or fails and there was a previous retry
item that now needs to be deleted. Sometimes there can be both kinds of item:
for example, if routing was deferred but then succeeded, and delivery then
deferred. In that case there is a delete item for the routing retry, and an
updating item for the delivery.

(But note that that is only visible at the outer level, because in remote
delivery subprocesses, the address starts &quot;clean&quot;, with no retry items carried
in.)

These items are used at the end of a delivery attempt to update the retry
database. The keys start R: for routing delays and T: for transport delays.

Arguments:
  addr    the address block onto which to hang the item
  key     the retry key
  flags   delete, host, and message flags, copied into the block

Returns:  nothing
