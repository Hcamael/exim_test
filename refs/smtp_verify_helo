<doc f='exim/src/smtp_in.c' l='3420'>/* This function is called if helo_verify_hosts or helo_try_verify_hosts is
matched. It is also called from ACL processing if verify = helo is used and
verification was not previously tried (i.e. helo_try_verify_hosts was not
matched). The result of its processing is to set helo_verified and
helo_verify_failed. These variables should both be FALSE for this function to
be called.

Note that EHLO/HELO is legitimately allowed to quote an address literal. Allow
for IPv6 ::ffff: literals.

Argument:   none
Returns:    TRUE if testing was completed;
            FALSE on a temporary failure
