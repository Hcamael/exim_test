<doc f='exim/src/smtp_in.c' l='3135'>/* This function is called when acl_check() fails. As well as calls from within
this module, it is called from receive.c for an ACL after DATA. It sorts out
logging the incident, and sends the error response. A message containing
newlines is turned into a multiline SMTP response, but for logging, only the
first line is used.

There&apos;s a table of default permanent failure response codes to use in
globals.c, along with the table of names. VFRY is special. Despite RFC1123 it
defaults disabled in Exim. However, discussion in connection with RFC 821bis
(aka RFC 2821) has concluded that the response should be 252 in the disabled
state, because there are broken clients that try VRFY before RCPT. A 5xx
response should be given only when the address is positively known to be
undeliverable. Sigh. We return 252 if there is no VRFY ACL or it provides
no explicit code, but if there is one we let it know best.
Also, for ETRN, 458 is given on refusal, and for AUTH, 503.

From Exim 4.63, it is possible to override the response code details by
providing a suitable response code string at the start of the message provided
in user_msg. The code&apos;s first digit is checked for validity.

Arguments:
  where        where the ACL was called from
  rc           the failure code
  user_msg     a message that can be included in an SMTP response
  log_msg      a message for logging

Returns:     0 in most cases
             2 if the failure code was FAIL_DROP, in which case the
               SMTP connection should be dropped (this value fits with the
               &quot;done&quot; variable in smtp_setup_msg() below)
