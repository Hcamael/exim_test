<doc f='exim/src/retry.c' l='501'>/* Update the retry data for any directing/routing/transporting that was
deferred, or delete it for those that succeeded after a previous defer. This is
done all in one go to minimize opening/closing/locking of the database file.

Note that, because SMTP delivery involves a list of destinations to try, there
may be defer-type retry information for some of them even when the message was
successfully delivered. Likewise if it eventually failed.

This function may move addresses from the defer to the failed queue if the
ultimate retry time has expired.

Arguments:
  addr_defer    queue of deferred addresses
  addr_failed   queue of failed addresses
  addr_succeed  queue of successful addresses

Returns:        nothing
