<doc f='exim/src/deliver.c' l='5470'>/* This is the function which is called when a message is to be delivered. It
is passed the id of the message. It is possible that the message no longer
exists, if some other process has delivered it, and it is also possible that
the message is being worked on by another process, in which case the data file
will be locked.

If no delivery is attempted for any of the above reasons, the function returns
DELIVER_NOT_ATTEMPTED.

If the give_up flag is set true, do not attempt any deliveries, but instead
fail all outstanding addresses and return the message to the sender (or
whoever).

A delivery operation has a process all to itself; we never deliver more than
one message in the same process. Therefore we needn&apos;t worry too much about
store leakage.

Liable to be called as root.

Arguments:
  id          the id of the message to be delivered
  forced      TRUE if delivery was forced by an administrator; this overrides
              retry delays and causes a delivery to be tried regardless
  give_up     TRUE if an administrator has requested that delivery attempts
              be abandoned

Returns:      When the global variable mua_wrapper is FALSE:
                DELIVER_ATTEMPTED_NORMAL   if a delivery attempt was made
                DELIVER_NOT_ATTEMPTED      otherwise (see comment above)
              When the global variable mua_wrapper is TRUE:
                DELIVER_MUA_SUCCEEDED      if delivery succeeded
                DELIVER_MUA_FAILED         if delivery failed
                DELIVER_NOT_ATTEMPTED      if not attempted (should not occur)
