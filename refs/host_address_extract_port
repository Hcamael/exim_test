<doc f='exim/src/host.c' l='378'>/* In the spool file, and in the -oMa and -oMi options, a host plus port is
given as an IP address followed by a dot and a port number. This function
decodes this.

An alternative format for the -oMa and -oMi options is [ip address]:port which
is what Exim 4 uses for output, because it seems to becoming commonly used,
whereas the dot form confuses some programs/people. So we recognize that form
too.

Argument:
  address    points to the string; if there is a port, the &apos;.&apos; in the string
             is overwritten with zero to terminate the address; if the string
             is in the [xxx]:ppp format, the address is shifted left and the
             brackets are removed

Returns:     0 if there is no port, else the port number. If there&apos;s a syntax
             error, leave the incoming address alone, and return 0.
