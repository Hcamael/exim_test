an A, AAAA, or A6 record. For the first two, there is only ever one address,
but the chaining feature of A6 allows for several addresses to be realized from
a single initial A6 record. The structure defines the address field of length
1. In use, a suitable sized block is obtained to hold the complete textual
address. */</doc>
