<doc f='exim/src/daemon.c' l='901'>/* The daemon can do two jobs, either of which is optional:

(1) Listens for incoming SMTP calls and spawns off a sub-process to handle
each one. This is requested by the -bd option, with -oX specifying the SMTP
port on which to listen (for testing).

(2) Spawns a queue-running process every so often. This is controlled by the
-q option with a an interval time. (If no time is given, a single queue run
is done from the main function, and control doesn&apos;t get here.)

Root privilege is required in order to attach to port 25. Some systems require
it when calling socket() rather than bind(). To cope with all cases, we run as
root for both socket() and bind(). Some systems also require root in order to
write to the pid file directory. This function must therefore be called as root
if it is to work properly in all circumstances. Once the socket is bound and
the pid file written, root privilege is given up if there is an exim uid.

There are no arguments to this function, and it never returns. */</doc>
