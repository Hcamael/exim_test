	 * !!!
	 * Some applications use DB but implement their own locking outside of
	 * DB.  If they&apos;re using fcntl(2) locking on the underlying database
	 * file, and we open and close a file descriptor for that file, we will
	 * discard their locks.  The DB_FCNTL_LOCKING flag to DB-&gt;open is an
	 * undocumented interface to support this usage which leaves any file
	 * descriptors we open until DB-&gt;close.  This will only work with the
	 * DB-&gt;open interface and simple caches, e.g., creating a transaction
	 * thread may open/close file descriptors this flag doesn&apos;t protect.
	 * Locking with fcntl(2) on a file that you don&apos;t own is a very, very
	 * unsafe thing to do.  &apos;Nuff said.
