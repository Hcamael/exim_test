<doc f='exim/src/verify.c' l='3122'>/* This function is passed a host list containing items in a number of
different formats and the identity of a host. Its job is to determine whether
the given host is in the set of hosts defined by the list. The host name is
passed as a pointer so that it can be looked up if needed and not already
known. This is commonly the case when called from verify_check_host() to check
an incoming connection. When called from elsewhere the host name should usually
be set.

This function is now just a front end to match_check_list(), which runs common
code for scanning a list. We pass it the check_host() function to perform a
single test.

Arguments:
  listptr              pointer to the host list
  cache_bits           pointer to cache for named lists, or NULL
  host_name            the host name or NULL, implying use sender_host_name and
                         sender_host_aliases, looking them up if required
  host_address         the IP address
  valueptr             if not NULL, data from a lookup is passed back here

Returns:    OK    if the host is in the defined set
            FAIL  if the host is not in the defined set,
            DEFER if a data lookup deferred (not a host lookup)

If the host name was needed in order to make a comparison, and could not be
determined from the IP address, the result is FAIL unless the item
&quot;+allow_unknown&quot; was met earlier in the list, in which case OK is returned. */</doc>
