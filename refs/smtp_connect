<doc f='exim/src/smtp_out.c' l='340'>/* Create a socket, and connect it to a remote host. IPv6 addresses are
detected by checking for a colon in the address. AF_INET6 is defined even on
non-IPv6 systems, to enable the code to be less messy. However, on such systems
host-&gt;address will always be an IPv4 address.

Arguments:
  host        host item containing name and address and port
  host_af     AF_INET or AF_INET6
  interface   outgoing interface address or NULL
  timeout     timeout value or 0
  tb          transport

Returns:      connected socket number, or -1 with errno set
