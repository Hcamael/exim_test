<doc f='exim/src/local_scan.c' l='31'>/* This is a &quot;do-nothing&quot; version of a local_scan() function. The arguments
are:

  fd             The file descriptor of the open -D file, which contains the
                   body of the message. The file is open for reading and
                   writing, but modifying it is dangerous and not recommended.

  return_text    A pointer to an unsigned char* variable which you can set in
                   order to return a text string. It is initialized to NULL.

The return values of this function are:

  LOCAL_SCAN_ACCEPT
                 The message is to be accepted. The return_text argument is
                   saved in $local_scan_data.

  LOCAL_SCAN_REJECT
                 The message is to be rejected. The returned text is used
                   in the rejection message.

  LOCAL_SCAN_TEMPREJECT
                 This specifies a temporary rejection. The returned text
                   is used in the rejection message.
