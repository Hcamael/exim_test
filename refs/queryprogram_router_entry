PASS

DEFER
  . verifying the errors address caused a deferment or a big disaster such
      as an expansion failure (rf_get_errors_address)
  . expanding a headers_{add,remove} string caused a deferment or another
      expansion error (rf_get_munge_headers)
  . a problem in rf_get_transport: no transport when one is needed;
      failed to expand dynamic transport; failed to find dynamic transport
  . bad lookup type
  . problem looking up host (rf_lookup_hostlist)
  . self = DEFER or FREEZE
  . failure to set up uid/gid for running the command
  . failure of transport_set_up_command: too many arguments, expansion fail
  . failure to create child process

OK
  . address added to addr_local or addr_remote for delivery
