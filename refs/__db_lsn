 * A DB_LSN has two parts, a fileid which identifies a specific file, and an
 * offset within that file.  The fileid is an unsigned 4-byte quantity that
 * uniquely identifies a file within the log directory -- currently a simple
 * counter inside the log.  The offset is also an unsigned 4-byte value.  The
 * log manager guarantees the offset is never more than 4 bytes by switching
 * to a new log file before the maximum length imposed by an unsigned 4-byte
 * offset is reached.
