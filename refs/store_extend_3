<doc f='exim/src/store.c' l='248'>/* While reading strings of unknown length, it is often the case that the
string is being read into the block at the top of the stack. If it needs to be
extended, it is more efficient just to extend the top block rather than
allocate a new block and then have to copy the data. This function is provided
for the use of string_cat(), but of course can be used elsewhere too.

Arguments:
  ptr        pointer to store block
  oldsize    current size of the block, as requested by user
  newsize    new size required
  filename   source file from which called
  linenumber line number in source file

Returns:     TRUE if the block is at the top of the stack and has been
             extended; FALSE if it isn&apos;t at the top of the stack, or cannot
             be extended
