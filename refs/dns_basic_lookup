<doc f='exim/src/dns.c' l='635'>/* Call the resolver to look up the given domain name, using the given type,
and check the result. The error code TRY_AGAIN is documented as meaning &quot;non-
Authoritative Host not found, or SERVERFAIL&quot;. Sometimes there are badly set
up nameservers that produce this error continually, so there is the option of
providing a list of domains for which this is treated as a non-existent
host.

Arguments:
  dnsa      pointer to dns_answer structure
  name      name to look up
  type      type of DNS record required (T_A, T_MX, etc)

Returns:    DNS_SUCCEED   successful lookup
            DNS_NOMATCH   name not found (NXDOMAIN)
                          or name contains illegal characters (if checking)
                          or name is an IP address (for IP address lookup)
            DNS_NODATA    domain exists, but no data for this type (NODATA)
            DNS_AGAIN     soft failure, try again later
            DNS_FAIL      DNS failure
