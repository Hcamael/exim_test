which  is apparently used by some UUCPs, despite it not being in RFC 976.
Because  of variations in time formats, just match up to the minutes. That
should  be sufficient. Examples have been seen of time fields like 12:1:03,
so  just require one digit for hours and minutes. The weekday is also absent
in  some forms. */</doc>
