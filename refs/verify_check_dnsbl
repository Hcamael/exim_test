<doc f='exim/src/verify.c' l='3621'>/* This function runs checks against a list of DNS black lists, until one
matches. Each item on the list can be of the form

  domain=ip-address/key

The domain is the right-most domain that is used for the query, for example,
blackholes.mail-abuse.org. If the IP address is present, there is a match only
if the DNS lookup returns a matching IP address. Several addresses may be
given, comma-separated, for example: x.y.z=127.0.0.1,127.0.0.2.

If no key is given, what is looked up in the domain is the inverted IP address
of the current client host. If a key is given, it is used to construct the
domain for the lookup. For example:

  dsn.rfc-ignorant.org/$sender_address_domain

After finding a match in the DNS, the domain is placed in $dnslist_domain, and
then we check for a TXT record for an error message, and if found, save its
value in $dnslist_text. We also cache everything in a tree, to optimize
multiple lookups.

The TXT record is normally looked up in the same domain as the A record, but
when many lists are combined in a single DNS domain, this will not be a very
specific message. It is possible to specify a different domain for looking up
TXT records; this is given before the main domain, comma-separated. For
example:

  dnslists = http.dnsbl.sorbs.net,dnsbl.sorbs.net=127.0.0.2 : \
             socks.dnsbl.sorbs.net,dnsbl.sorbs.net=127.0.0.3

The caching ensures that only one lookup in dnsbl.sorbs.net is done.

Note: an address for testing RBL is 192.203.178.39
Note: an address for testing DUL is 192.203.178.4
Note: a domain for testing RFCI is example.tld.dsn.rfc-ignorant.org

Arguments:
  where        the acl type
  listptr      the domain/address/data list
  log_msgptr   log message on error

Returns:    OK      successful lookup (i.e. the address is on the list), or
                      lookup deferred after +include_unknown
            FAIL    name not found, or no data found for the given type, or
                      lookup deferred after +exclude_unknown (default)
            DEFER   lookup failure, if +defer_unknown was set
