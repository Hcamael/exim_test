just saves repeating this code too many times. It does an expansion, and
chooses a suitable return code on error.

Arguments:
  addr       the address that&apos;s being routed
  s          the string to be expanded
  prc        pointer to where to put the return code on failure

Returns:     the expanded string, or NULL (with prc set) on failure
